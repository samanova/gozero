                <p class="r-slab-bold-heading">To make Earth healthier.</p>
                <p class="r-regular">The average american sends 4.4lbs of trash to the landfill every day. We live in a
                    disposable society where we don't value our belongings, and we're consuming way too many resources.
                    Earth Overshoot Day, recorded annually, marks when we've consumed all of the resources the earth can
                    sustainably produce for the coming year. In 2017, Earth Overshoot day was August 2nd, which means
                    we're
                    essentially consuming 1.5 earths.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond our overconsumption problem, landfills are toxic. They're responsible for 20% of the methane
                    emissions in the US, and they aren't aerated for proper decomposition of natural materials. Toxins
                    from cleaners, batteries, small electronics (and other items that shouldn't be landfilled) leach
                    into the soil and can run off into the ocean and ground water when it rains.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There's also a great deal of trash that doesn't make it to the landfill. Instead, it clutters the
                    sides of roads and
                    swirls in the ocean. Plastic is especially dangerous to the ocean, marine life, and our health. It
                    doesn't biodegrade – it photodegrades, which means it only gets smaller and smaller. Each
                    micro-plankton in the ocean has 36 micro-plastic pieces to match. Plastic breaks down so small
                    that it's in drinking 90% of drinking water both bottled and tap world wide.</p>

                <p class="r-slab-bold-heading">To improve our day-to-day life.</p>
                <p class="r-regular">Don't take the bad news as a reason not to recycle! However, the recycling system
                    is indeed flawed, and learning how you can reduce your production of waste will help you to depend
                    less on recycling services – instead focus your efforts on reducing and reusing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With just one small step at a time, you can greatly reduce your footprint. But, going zero waste
                    isn't just great for the environment, you'll notice an improvement in your quality of life. Side
                    effects include eating better, feeling better, saving money, and not having to take out the trash!
