                <p class="r-slab-bold-heading">The short version</p>
                <p class="r-regular">The main goal is to send nothing, or nearly nothing, to the landfills. Reduce what
                    you need, reuse as much as you can, send little to be recycled, and compost what you cannot. At the
                    onset it may seem impossible, but every small step toward zero waste is a step forward for the
                    health of the planet and all who live on it. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="r-slab-bold-heading">The longer version</p>
                <p class="r-regular">Everyone's first thought is reducing, reusing, and recycling. Simple, right? The
                    real, underlying problem lies with the dire necessity to redefine the waste systems in the United
                    States and the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We currently live in a linear economy where we take resources from the earth
                    and then dump them in a giant hole in the ground. The goal of
                    zero waste is to move to a circular economy – which mimics nature by being without unnecessary waste
                    – where we write trash out of existence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Instead of discarding resources, we create a system where all resources can be resumed fully back into the system.
